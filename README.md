Adding dates from an XML File into an Excel template usually starts with seeing the wrong data in every row.   BI Publisher seems to be ignoring the XML Date value and just printing the generic field value from the template.

Properly handling the dates between the XML File and Excel is actually quite easy once you understand what is happening and how to correct the issue.
